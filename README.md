# Supplement-to-DVRP-MHSI
This material is the supplement to the paper "DVRP-MHSI: Dynamic Visualization Research Platform for Multimodal Human-Swarm Interaction". Related work on swarm systems is introduced in Section 1. Section 2 gives some important parameters of the screen and explains in detail the design of the robot (including structural design, electrical design, and motion control). The results of demonstration experiments are presented and discussed in Section 3.
The video of the experiment is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LMepeiESM/. 
The video of related multi-robot studies based on DVRP-MHSI (including multi-robot task allocation, multi-robot formation, multi-robot path planning, and multi-robot circumnavigation) is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11Hp2e9EvY/.
